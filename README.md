# Sandwich Club Udacity Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I have complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Because, this project helpped me understand how to build a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON. While JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, this project helps me to better understand how it is processed.

## What Have I Learned?
Through this project, I have:
- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
